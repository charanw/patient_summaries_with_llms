        "## Instructions\n",
        "For this labelling task, we are interested in errors in the AVS that are either unsupported by the\n",
        "BHC, contradict content in the BHC, or are wrong medical facts. We allow statements that contain\n",

        "1. Unsupported facts, including condition/procedure/medication/time/location/\n",
        "number/name/word/other\n",
        "2. Contradicted fact\n",
        "3. Incorrect fact\n",
        "And below is the detailed guideline, and we label error spans with the <error> tag (e.g. <error\n",
        "class=\"error type\">incorrect fact</error>).\n",
        "### Determining Span of Errors\n",
        "We label the smallest possible consecutive span that specifies the error given the BHC as a\n",
        "context. Removing further parts from the span would remove important information. A useful\n",
        "heuristic is to identify the minimal span that must be replaced to obtain a correct statement that\n",
        "is grammatically correct. For example\n",
        "- \"We performed an <error>esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD).<error>\" when no such procedure\n",

        "performed \"performed an esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD)\" should be labeled as error because\n",
        "there is no suitable substitute for \"esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD)\".\n",
        "- \"After the surgery, we <error>transitioned you to oral oxycodone</error>.\" when the BHC\n",
        "contains no information for such a transition. If another medication transition is mentioned in\n",
        "the BHC and makes sense in this sentence only \"oral oxycodone\" should be labeled. If another oral\n",
        "medication transition is mentioned in the BHC only \"oxycodone\" should be labeled.\n",
        "- \"<error>Your symptoms responded well</error>.\" when no part of the sentence makes sense in the\n",
        "given context of the AVS.\n",
        "We allow general medical knowledge and advice that is often part of the AVS. Usually, these are\n",
        "information that are not specific for the hospital course given in the BHC. For example\n",
        "- \"Please take your medications as prescribed\" contains no error even though the BHC does not\n",
        "contain this instruction because this is general medical advice.\n",
        "- \"If the symptoms get worse, please contact your doctor\" contains no error even when the BHC\n",
        "does not contain this fact, since it is general medical knowledge that a doctor should be seen\n",
        "for worsening symptoms.\n",
        "We try to ignore grammatical errors in the BHC and AVS. If the original meaning can still be\n",
        "inferred (e.g. \"medictaions\" instead of \"medications\"), the most likely corrected form can be\n",
        "used. If the meaning cannot be inferred, they can be ignored in the BHC or labeled as Unsupported\n",
        "Other in the AVS.\n",
        "If a sentence or phrase is repeated, then please treat it as you would any other sentence and\n",

        "sometimes they belong to a wrong statement or clearly contain unsupported information (e.g., a\n",
        "doctor’s name or phone numbers) that are not given in the BHC. In these cases, deidentified fields\n",

        "### Error Types\n",
        "In general, we ask for the most specific error that is applicable. If there is uncertainty which\n",
        "type applies, prefer the one mentioned first in the enumeration of all error types shown earlier.\n",
        "For instance, if the error contains an unsupported medication name, the Unsupported medication type\n",
        "should be used instead of the Unsupported name type. Here is a detailed description of the error\n",
        "types:\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Condition‘: includes unsupported symptoms, diseases, or findings of the patient.\n",
        "For example\n",
        "- \"You were found to have a <error class=\"unsupported condition\">left clavicle\n",
        "fracture</error>\" when no information was given for this condition in the BHC.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Procedure‘: includes any unsupported medical procedures. For example\n",
        "- \"You had a <error class=\"unsupported procedure\">filter placed in your vein</error>\" when no\n",
        "intervention with a filter was mentioned.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Medication‘: contains all errors related to unsupported medications. This includes\n",
        "medication classes, substances, routes, frequencies, and dosages. For example\n",
        "- \"You were placed on <error class=\"unsupported medication\">antibiotics</error>\" when only\n",
        "blood thinners were prescribed.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Time‘: includes all errors for unsupported time or interval statements. For\n",
        "example\n",
        "- \"Keep your arm in a sling for the <error class=\"unsupported time\">next 6 weeks</error>\"\n",
        "when no specific duration is given.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Location‘: Locations include both unsupported physical places as well as regions of\n",
        "the patient. For example\n",
        "- \"The patient was admitted to the <error class=\"unsupported location\">Acute Surgery\n",
        "Service</error>\" when no admission location was provided in the BHC.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Number‘: any number either as digits or written that are unsupported. This also\n",
        "includes words such as \"a\" and \"an\". For example\n",
        "- \"Your pacemaker rate was increased to <error class=\"unsupported number\">50</error>\" when\n",
        "the rate of 50 is not given in the BHC.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Name‘: named entities that are not supported by the BHC. For example\n",
        "- \"You were seen by the <error class=\"unsupported name\">interventional pulmonary\n",
        "service</error>\" when no consult with this service was mentioned in the BHC. - ‘Unsupported\n",
        "Word‘: incorrect or inappropriate words or phrases which do not fit in any of the above types.\n",
        "For example\n",
        "- \"We will send you home with a <error class=\"unsupported word\">drain</error> in place\" when\n",
        "drain not mentioned in the BHC.\n",
        "- ‘Unsupported Other‘: If there is a mistake which clearly does not belong to any of the above\n",
        "categories, you may use this category as a last resort. We cannot give precise instructions\n",
        "because the \"other\" category is very broad.\n",
        "- ‘Contradicted Fact‘: This error type is independent of the content and contains all facts that\n",
        "clearly contradict information provided in the BHC. For example\n",
        "- \"Your pacemaker rate was increased to <error class=\"contradicted fact\">50</error>\" when the\n",
        "context state a pacemaker rate of 40.\n",
        "- ‘Incorrect Fact‘: This error type is independent of the content and contains all facts that\n",
        "clearly contradict general medical knowledge or advice. For example\n",
        "- \"We diagnosed a seizure, and you <error class=\"incorrect fact\">can continue driving your\n",
        "car</error>\" when no reason for allowing driving after a seizure is provided this contradict\n",
